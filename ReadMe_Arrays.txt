Array is a way of storing a collection of data of the same type together. It is better and easier then storing it in individual variables. An array is not a type but a collection of variables. You make an array by writing a type followed by brackets. You can then put the name of the array. The items inside an array are called elements. You can get individual variables inside an array. To get an array you need its index. The index is like the number of steps it is from the first element. The first element’s index is 0.
