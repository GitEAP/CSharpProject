Conventions and Syntax
Coding syntax is just the structure of the language. Conventions are essential to learning to read and write code. The dot operator is a full stop or period. Dots are placed between words within code. It’s like writing a web address. For example “Debug.Log(transform.position.x)”. It is compound items with many elements. The dot separates the item and the element. Another convention is the semi colon. It is used to terminate statements. That is why it’s always at the end of lines of code. All statements have semi colons. Class declarations don’t use a semi colon it uses brackets. Functions and if statements don’t use the semi colon either. 
C# vs. JS Syntax
C# has the class declarations shown. In JavaScript the declaration is hidden. Because it’s hidden, anything that you write in the script it is added inside the class. In C# classes start with a type of variable. You then name the variable and give it a default value. In JavaScript you start by writing the keyword var. You then name the variable. You type a colon and then you give it a type. For functions in C# you start with the type of variable or use void if not returning anything, then you set the parameters. In JavaScript you start with the keyword function, then the function name, and last the parameter with a return type.
