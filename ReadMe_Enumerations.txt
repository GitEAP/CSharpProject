Enumerations are referred as enums. Enumerations are a special data type that has a specific subset of possible values. Enumerations can be created inside or outside of a class. You use it inside if only that class needs access to it. If other classes need it you place it outside. The syntax of a enumeration starts with the keyword enum. It is followed by the name. The name is capitalized because it is a type and not a variable. Then you add the constants of the enumeration. The constants are separated by commas and placed inside braces. By default they are integers starting with 0.
