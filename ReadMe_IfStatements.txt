If statements are used to make decisions based on a condition. An extension of an if statement is an if-else statement. This will give the statement a default decision. You can get another extension with an else if. You can have as many else if statements as you want. You can only have one if and one else though. This will give it an additional condition. It will have two conditions to check before going to the else statement. The first two condition will not be executed if they are both false. If statement can be used in code to tell it what to do.
