Loops in programming are used to repeat lines of code. Loops are also referred as iteration. There are four types of loops that are common they are: while loop, do-while loop, for loop, and for each loop. A while loop starts with the keyword while. In parentheses there is a conditional. As long as the conditional is true it will repeat the code. After the conditional there are braces. Inside the braces goes the code you want to repeat. This is known as the body. The other loops syntax is identical with the exception of the keyword. The conditional is also different for every type of loop.
