When making decisions in code it is common to use if statements or switch statements. A switch statement is a streamline conditional that is used when you want to compare a single variable to a series of constants. A common usage in using switches is to make decisions based on enumerations. The syntax starts with the keyword switch followed by parentheses. Inside the parentheses is the variable that will be compared. Inside the switch statement there are cases. Each case is the constant that will be compared to the variable. Inside the case is the code. After the code you need to add break to get out of the switch statement.
